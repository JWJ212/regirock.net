                    <h1>You can still be secure online!</h1>
                    <p>Recently I have noticed a huge surge in the number of people who simply do not care about their online security. The main reason I see for this is them assuming that it is a complete lost cause. I hear things like "It doesn't matter what you do tracking is everywhere so you don't need to go through the extra effort to be secure" This is like me saying that I leave my front door wide open because if someone wants to break in they could just smash my window</p>
                    <p>This idea is incredibly dumb to me, as it should be to you. And to remedy this I'm going to provide a couple tips for security that require near zero effort and make your life significantly better</p>

                    <p><strong>Browser choice</strong></p>
                    <p>The first and easiest thing is choosing the right browser. Personally I use <a href="https://librewolf.net>LibreWolf">LibreWolf</a> as my daily driver. This is because of two main reasons 1. It isn't chromium and 2. It has everything related to a company (Mozilla) removed. LibreWolf is a fork of Firefox which removes everything relating to Mozilla. This results in the browser being extremely lightweight and snappy. There are many other browsers that may have other benefits for your usecase so I reccomend looking around if LibreWolf isn't right for you. There are a few browsers you should stay clear of at all times however. They are as follows, Google Chrome, Opera (this includes GX), Edge, and anything that looks like a virus. I think no one should use a chromium browser but if you are going to I reccomend using <a href="https://vivaldi.net">Vivaldi</a> If you don't need a chromium browser and go with Firefox or LibreWolf make sure you check out <a href="https://ffprofile.com">Firefox Profile Maker</a> This allows you to pick and choose security settings along with extensions that help with this.</p>
                    <p><strong>Passwords</strong></p>
                    <p>The biggest thing that you can do to protect yourself online is to use a password manager and autogenerate passwords. Personally, I selfhost an instance of <a href="https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden">Vaultwarden</a> and I reccomend doing the same if you have the knowhow and infastructure for it. However, there are many password managers, but I would say just signing up for <a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a> account is decent. An even simpler, and more secure approach would be to buy a password notebook and autogenerate passwords on your computer using random data. The next step would be to make sure you use different, generated passwords for everything. Never re-use a single password no matter what (unless it's for an account that you don't care about losing). A more extreme thing would be to use a password rotation, but I consider this overkill outside of a setting where you are actively being targeted (i.e. businesses, government facilities, etc.).</p>
                    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
                    <p>As you've just seen being secure online is not a lost cause. There are ways to protect yourself that can even make your life easier, and all for very little effort. Being secure online isn't a figment of the past, no matter how much big tech would like you to believe that.</p>
